[database]
# Module to use. Can be 'mysql', 'postgres' or 'sqlite'.

username: test
password: tset
database: testdb

# Number of connections to hold open to the DB. If you find some queries
# (such as statistics) creating a backlog, increase this number. Try not
# to go too high, though. This probably doesn't work well at all for SQLite.
connections: 2

# The address our mail should appear to be from. This should really be a valid
# e-mail address.

# A space-seperate list of e-mail addresses. We mail these people a traceback
# when things explode. If you don't want to do this, leave it blank.

# Vhost to use. This must be a dotted quad or FQDN of an IP on a _local_
# interface. You can use IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Leave it blank if you
