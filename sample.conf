[database]
# Module to use. Can be 'mysql', 'postgres' or 'sqlite'.
module: mysql

# Pretty easy to work out what these are for. SQLite only needs 'database',
# which should be a path to your SQLite database file.
hostname: localhost
username: test
password: tset
database: testdb

# Number of connections to hold open to the DB. If you find some queries
# (such as statistics) creating a backlog, increase this number. Try not
# to go too high, though. Setting this higher than 1 will not work properly
# if you are using SQLite!
connections: 2


[DNS]
# Number of minutes to cache a DNS response
cache_time: 180

# Number of threads to have in our resolver pool
resolver_threads: 2

# Should we try to use IPv6? NOTE: if you enable this, you may run into random
# slow name resolution. This seems to be due to stupid nameservers that gag on
# the query getaddrinfo() sends. Instead of sending an NXDOMAIN reply, they
# just let the connection time out. Grrrrrr.
use_ipv6: 0

# Order that we should try IPs in for HTTP and IRC. Leaving this blank will
# just use whatever order your system returns the results in.
http_order: 4
irc_order: 4
#irc_order: 6 4


[HTTP]
# The user agent that we should send when making any http requests
useragent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511

# The maximum number of files we should be trying to fetch via HTTP at once.
connections: 4

# The number of seconds we should wait for a connection to time out.
connect_timeout: 20

# The number of times we should redirect before giving up.
redirect_limit: 3


[mail]
# The hostname or IP address of our SMTP server.
server: localhost

# The address our mail should appear to be from. This should really be a valid
# e-mail address.
from: TestBot <hangle@loves.you>

# A space-seperate list of e-mail addresses. We mail these people a traceback
# when things explode. Unless you plan to be doing your own plugin development,
# PLEASE leave this address in the list so I can catch bugs.
tracebacks: freddie+tracebacks@madcowdisease.org


[logging]
# Relative location of your log file.
log_file: logs/sample.log

# Log all commands to the database? You must import schemas/CommandLog.sql
# for this to work.
log_commands: 0

# Spam miscellaneous DEBUG messages? Usually helpful info.
debug: 1
# Spam a whole lot of DEBUG messages for internal message traffic? Almost
# certainly not helpful. Very noisy.
debug_msg: 0
# Spam DEBUG messages for database queries? Sometimes helpful.
debug_query: 0


[network.hyper]
# Name of this network, for logging/etc

# Space seperate list of nicknames to use
nicks: testbot

# Username to send. This really only does something if you don't have identd.
username: test

# 'Real name' to send. Shows up on /whois. Leaving this blank will make
# us use 'blamehangle!' as a default.
realname:

# Vhost to use. This must be an IP or FQDN of an IP on a local interface.
# You can use IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Leave it blank if you just want to
# use the default interface.

# Maximum length line to send to the server, at least for NOTICE/PRIVMSG.
max_line_length: 400

# Maximum number of lines to split long output into. Setting this higher can
# make it easy for people to lag or even flood us off.
max_split_lines: 2

# Combine targets? If the same text is being sent to more than one channel
# at a time (News, for instance), we can send it as a single PRIVMSG. This
# may not work on all networks, and might even get you K-Lined for spam or
# something similar.
combine_targets: 0

# Ignore anyone not in a channel with us? This will stop banned people
# abusing us, or trying to flood us off.
ignore_strangers: 1

# Some stuff for talking to NickServ. Note that we currently won't use
# the GHOST command to get our nick back.

# If you don't want to use NickServ, set both of these to nothing or
