critical:

important:
	* SamplePlugin needs updating! (fred, sort of started)
	* Find a nice way to make genhelp document plugin flags.


not important but more than whatever:
	* Proper NickServ support, including the GHOST command (kill people with
	  our nick), and waiting until we're identified before joining channels.


whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)
	* script to import infobot.org factpacks (someone)


plugins:
	* Spam text at intervals (easy way to use PluginTimedEvent?)
	* MapQuest: return URL with other data (?)
	* SmartyPants: random factoid spam at interval(s)
	* 'seen'? Is possible now, woob.
	* News: admin command to flush news queue.
