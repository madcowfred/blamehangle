critical:

important:
	* rhyme, synonyms, antonyms - looks like the site changed its html.

not important but more than whatever:
	* NickServ GHOST command support (kill people with our nick, or timed
	  out versions of ourselves)

whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)


plugins:
	* Spam text at intervals (easy way to use PluginTimedEvent?)
	* MapQuest: return URL with other data (?)
	* SmartyPants: random factoid spam at interval(s)
	* 'seen'? not possible for a plugin with the current range of IRCT events.
	* SmartyPants: Add/remove/ignore users via ctcp for admin. Possibly
	  move user list to database?
	* News: admin command to flush news queue.
