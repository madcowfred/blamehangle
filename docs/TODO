critical:

important:
	* Generic DB-backed way of storing/verifying user data. Needs to
	  have a way for plugins to add their own flags. There are currently
	  at least two seperate user settings (both for SmartyPants?).
	
	* Seems like it is finally time to do the plugin trigger prioritisation
	  stuff. (zhar, when he gets bored)

not important but more than whatever:
	* NickServ auth (fred, since zhar has never even seen a nickserv)

whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)


plugins:
	* Stock quotes & symbol lookups
	* dictionary.com lookup
	* Spam text at intervals (easy way to use PluginTimedEvent?
	* MapQuest: return URL with other data
	* SmartyPants: random factoid spam at interval(s)
	* Karma: combine nicknames
	* Karma: top/bottom <n> karmas
	* animenfo.com lookup
	* 'seen' (last time someone was seen)
	* Leave notes for people (possibly combined with above)
	* SmartyPants: Add/remove/ignore users via ctcp for admin. Possibly
	  move user list to database?
	* World time/date display
	* News: admin command to flush news queue.
