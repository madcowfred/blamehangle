core:
	* Reorganise directory layout.
	* Split HTTP client up into multiple functions so it's not so hard to understand.
	* Clean up the Common.py travesty.
	* Find a nice way to make genhelp document plugin flags. (?)
	* Make options loading transparent for plugins, most likely before plugin.rehash
	  is called.
	* Work out a better way to handle common Plugin access control tasks: must be in
	  channel/must have mode/must have bot flag/etc.
	* Stealthyish plugins that only 'exist' in specific channels. Probably depends on
	  the above.
	* Allow Plugin objects to return some sort of BAD_COMMAND message to make the bot
	  pretend the command is invalid.
	* Proper NickServ support, including the GHOST command (kill our nick), waiting
	  until we're identified before joining channels. Complicated by the 97000
	  varieties of NickServ/AuthServ.


plugins:
	* 'seen' plugin.
	* News: admin command to flush news queue.
	* SmartyPants: script to import infobot.org factpacks


whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)
