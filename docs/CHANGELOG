0.1.1             2005-??-??
----------------------------
* classes.ChatterGizmo: fix some issues with rehash not updating the channel
    list properly, remove nasty global rejoins list hack.
* classes.Common: QuoteURL() no longer quotes '=' and '?'.
* classes.HTTPMonster: fix redirection limit not working, fix redirected POST
    requests not using GET on the redirected URL, fix double urlparse for each
    URL which was unquoting spaces somehow.
* classes.WrapConn: make each wrap keep track of it's own channel rejoins,
    fix adding a channel key then rehashing not joining the channel correctly,
    only do join/stoned check if we finished connecting to the server.
* plugins.Google: fix result parsing so we don't end up with a silly trailing
    quote.
* plugins.Karma: give an error straight away for absurdly long key names.
* plugins.Misc: fix a missing bracket, fix various issues with the 'fedex'
    command page parsing.
* plugins.MoneyMangler: fix ASX page parsing, rename all of the page parsing
    methods to __Parse_Foo.
* plugins.Quotes: add a new 'allow_public_addquote' option, guess what it
    does!
* plugins.TorrentScraper: add a new 'ttl' page type, simplify 'bnbt' page
    parsing, don't retry broken torrents (404, etc) for a while, don't start
    the RSS feed generation timer if rss_interval is 0, fix some more quoted
    entity nastiness.
* plugins.Video: disable 'tvtome' command, since Cnet bought them out and it
    now sucks.
* plugins.WordStuff: fix acronym page parsing, fix urban dictionary page
    parsing.
