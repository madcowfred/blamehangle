----------------------------
* classes.ChatterGizmo: fix some issues with rehash not updating the channel
    list properly.
* classes.Common: QuoteURL() no longer quotes '=' and '?'.
* classes.HTTPMonster: fix redirection limit not working, fix redirected POST
    requests not using GET on the redirected URL, fix double urlparse for each
    URL which was unquoting spaces somehow.
* plugins.Google: fix result parsing so we don't end up with a silly trailing
    quote.

* plugins.Misc: fix a missing bracket.
* plugins.MoneyMangler: fix ASX page parsing, rename all of the page parsing
    methods to __Parse_Foo.
* plugins.TorrentScraper: add a new 'ttl' page type, simplify 'bnbt' page
    parsing, don't retry broken torrents (404, etc) for a while, don't start
    the RSS feed generation timer if rss_interval is 0, fix some more quoted
    entity nastiness.
* plugins.Video: disable 'tvtome' command, since Cnet bought them out and it
    now sucks.
* plugins.WordStuff: fix acronym page parsing.
