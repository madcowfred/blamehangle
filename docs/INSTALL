Requirements
------------
* Python 2.2.x or greater
* For some plugins, you will need a database of some kind. We currently support
  MySQL, Postgres and SQLite via the MySQLdb, PyGreSQL and PySQLite modules
  respectively.

Installation
------------
 1. Since you're reading this, you've probably already extracted the files from
    the .tar.gz. For the first step, you need to make a copy of the 'configs/'
    directory:
    
    $ cp -R configs newname
 
 2. If any plugins that you plan to use have their own configuration file, edit
    'newname/Plugin.conf'.
 
 3. Copy 'sample.conf' to a new file, and open it up. There are quite a few
    important options to set here, so follow the comments and get to it :)
    Make sure you change the 'plugin/config_dir' option to the name you chose
    for newname in the previous step.
 
 4. For each plugin you want to use, you may need to create a database table.
    Look in the 'schemas/' directory for the CREATE commands. For MySQL, you can
    use:
    
    $ mysql -u user -p database < SomePlugin.sql
    
    And for PostgreSQL:
    
    $ psql database < SomePlugin.sql
    
    And for SQLite:
    
    $ sqlite my.db < SomePlugin.sql
 
 5. Start the bot (preferably under screen):
    
    $ ./start-blamehangle new.conf
