* Python 2.2.x or greater

  MySQL and Postgres, via the MySQLdb and PyGreSQL modules respectively.

Installation
------------
 1. Since you're reading this, you've probably already extracted the files from
    the .tar.gz. For the first step, you need to make a copy of the 'configs/'
    directory:
    
    $ cp -R configs newname
 
 2. Copy 'sample.conf' to a new file, and open it up. There are quite a few
    important options to set here, so follow the comments and get to it :)
    Make sure you change the 'plugin/config_dir' option to the name you chose
    for newname in the previous step.
 
 3. If any plugins that you plan to use have their own configuration file, edit
    'newname/Plugin.conf'.
 
 4. Start the bot:
    
    $ ./start-blamehangle 'new.conf'
