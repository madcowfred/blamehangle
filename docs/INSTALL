Requirements
------------
* Python 2.3.x or greater
* For some plugins, you will need a database of some kind. We currently support
  MySQL, Postgres and SQLite via the MySQLdb, PyGreSQL and PySQLite modules
  respectively.

Installation
------------
1. Since you're reading this, you've probably already extracted the files from
   the .tar.gz. For the first step, you need to make a copy of the 'configs/'
   directory:
   
   $ cp -R configs newname

2. If any plugins that you plan to use have their own configuration file, edit
   'newname/Plugin.conf'.

3. Copy 'sample.conf' to a new file, and open it up. There are quite a few
   important options to set here, so follow the comments and get to it :)
   Make sure you change the 'plugin/config_dir' option to the name you chose
   for newname in the first step.
   
   Read docs/Plugins.html to see a current list of plugins and what they can do.

4. Start the bot (preferably under screen):
   
   $ ./start-blamehangle new.conf

5. Since the above command will restart the bot if it crashes/is shut down, you'll
   need to create a file called "STOP.new" in the blamehangle directory (for the
   above example), then press Ctrl-C.
