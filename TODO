critical:
	* HTTPMonster - work on making the page fetching not block the entire
	                app (anyone)
	* SmartyPants (anyone)
	* News - think up a replacement for HTMLParser, since it seems to
	         suck -- I may have fixed this, leave it be and see if it 
			 breaks (anyone)

important:
	* Port the global ignore list from MCO? (fred)
	* user/access list for the SmartyPants (zhar?)
	* convert db.dump once the bot is ready for it, and we have a newer dump
	  (both + dene)
	* configs/ dir, with a config file for the main bot and each plugin (that
	  needs one) (anyone)
	* to go with the above, make plugins use configs instead of hardcoded crap
	  all over the place (anyone)

whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)
	* Come up with more ideas for plugins (anyone)
	* Come up with more stuff for the TODO list ;) (fred!)
