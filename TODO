critical:
	* News - leave testbot running for ages to make sure that the news memory
	  leak bloating has been fixed, and that HTMLParser is no longer causing
	  any pain.

important:
	* SmartyPants - is there any more to add? (anyone)
	* convert db.dump once the bot is ready for it, and we have a newer dump
	  (both + dene) -- do we really need a newer dump? it's not like people
	  have been setting new stuff on efnet
	* Go through plugins and move hardcoded stuff out of them into files in
	  the configs dir as appropriate -- I think this is mostly done

not important but more than whatever:
	* stuff from sey's emails (anyone)
	* admin interface? (fred, port from MCO?) -- this probably isn't needed
	* Fix Karma so that it doesn't use KARMA_MOD hackery and instead uses the
	  "if typ == types.TupleType:" form like in SmartyPants (anyone)
	* dict plugin (fred!)
	* Mobygames/HOTU searches (fred?)
	* Signal handler on SIGHUP to trigger a config rehash as well. (anyone)
	* make Children.urlQuery(), much like Children.dbQuery() .. and go through
	* everything and change all the sendMessage('HTTPMonster, blahblah) things
	  to use urlQuery() (anyone)

whatever:
	* other plugins from Pinky that we care about (stuff like the quotes can
	  fuck off) (anyone)
	* Speaking of quotes... random text spammer plugin, for OQ (anyone)
	* Speaking of random text spammer, random factoid spam? (anyone)
	* testing! :) (anyone)
	* Come up with more ideas for plugins (anyone)
