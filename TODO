critical:
	* HTTPMonster - work on making the page fetching not block the entire
	                app (anyone)
	* SmartyPants (anyone)
	* News - think up a replacement for HTMLParser, since it seems to
	         suck (anyone)

important:
	* Port the global ignore list from MCO? (fred)
	* user/access list for the SmartyPants (zhar?)
	* finalise the factoid table structure, and convert db.dump (both)

whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)
	* Come up with more ideas for plugins (anyone)
	* Come up with more stuff for the TODO list ;) (fred!)
