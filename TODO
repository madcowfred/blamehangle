critical:
	* Testing to make sure the new threading code for HTTPMonster and
	  DataMonkey actually works

important:
	* convert db.dump once the bot is ready for it, and we have a newer dump
	  (both + dene) -- do we really need a newer dump? it's not like people
	  have been setting new stuff on efnet

not important but more than whatever:
	* stuff from sey's emails (anyone)
	* Mobygames/HOTU searches (fred?)
	* make Children.urlQuery(), much like Children.dbQuery() .. and go through
	  everything and change all the sendMessage('HTTPMonster, blahblah) things
	  to use urlQuery() (anyone)
	* Do something about a <reply> or <action> in the middle of a factoid,
	  maybe? (anyone)
	* dict plugin (anyone)

whatever:
	* other plugins from Pinky that we care about (stuff like the quotes can
	  fuck off) (anyone)
	* Speaking of quotes... random text spammer plugin, for OQ (anyone)
	* Speaking of random text spammer, random factoid spam? (anyone)
	* testing! :) (anyone)
