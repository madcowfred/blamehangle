critical:
	* HTTPMonster - work on making the page fetching not block the entire
	                app (anyone) (is this still blocking?)
	* SmartyPants - is there any more to add? (anyone)
	* News - think up a replacement for HTMLParser, since it seems to
	         suck -- I may have fixed this, leave it be and see if it 
			 breaks -- More HTMLParser woe, google news sometimes generates
			 broken html.. it wraps a href up in ' ' even if that href contains
			 ' in its text. (anyone)

important:
	* Port the global ignore list from MCO? (fred)
	* convert db.dump once the bot is ready for it, and we have a newer dump
	  (both + dene)
	* Go through plugins and move hardcoded stuff out of them into files in
	  the configs dir as appropriate

whatever:
	* testing! :) (anyone)
	* Come up with more ideas for plugins (anyone)
