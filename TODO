critical:

important:
	* convert db.dump once the bot is ready for it, and we have a newer dump
	  (both + dene)
	* add/port the 'stoned check' from MadCowOffer, so the bot doesn't get
	  stuck thinking it's connected when the server died ages ago (fred)

not important but more than whatever:
	* NickServ auth (fred, since zhar has never even seen a nickserv)
	* dict plugin (anyone)

whatever:
	* Mobygames/HOTU searches (fred?)
	* Speaking of quotes... random text spammer plugin, for OQ (anyone)
	* Speaking of random text spammer, random factoid spam? (anyone)
	* testing! :) (anyone)
