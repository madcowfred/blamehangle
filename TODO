critical:
	* Testing to make sure the new threading code for HTTPMonster and
	  DataMonkey actually works

important:
	* convert db.dump once the bot is ready for it, and we have a newer dump
	  (both + dene) -- do we really need a newer dump? it's not like people
	  have been setting new stuff on efnet
	* Add a description/summary column to the News table, and change things so
	  that the verbose parsers are always used. The verbose option should then
	  just toggle displaying the contents of this column. News search should
	  always display the summary with the URL if a single match is found. This
	  will also fix the lame behaviour of storing the description/summary in
	  the url column like we do currently.. and it gets chopped at 255
	  characters. (zhar)

not important but more than whatever:
	* stuff from sey's emails (anyone)
	* Mobygames/HOTU searches (fred?)
	* make Children.urlQuery(), much like Children.dbQuery() .. and go through
	  everything and change all the sendMessage('HTTPMonster, blahblah) things
	  to use urlQuery() (anyone)
	* Do something about a <reply> or <action> in the middle of a factoid,
	  maybe? (anyone)
	* dict plugin (anyone)

whatever:
	* other plugins from Pinky that we care about (stuff like the quotes can
	  fuck off) (anyone)
	* Speaking of quotes... random text spammer plugin, for OQ (anyone)
	* Speaking of random text spammer, random factoid spam? (anyone)
	* testing! :) (anyone)
